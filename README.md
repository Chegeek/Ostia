### Ostia is a cryptocurrency trading platform that allows you to test and run algorithmic trading strategies.

## Getting started
The easiest way to run Ostia is to deploy it to Heroku -- or you can clone the app locally and run it on your machine.

### Deploy to Heruoku 
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Or just go to an already deployed version here: http://ostrade.herokuapp.com/ (might take a second for the Heroku dyno to spin up)


### Install and run locally on your machine
```
git clone https://github.com/adamalawrence/Ostia.git
```
First of all make sure you have Node properly installed. Then...
1. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
2. Start application
```
npm start
```
3. Visit the Ostia dashboard on your browser
```
localhost:3000/
```

Note: you may have to refresh the page once or twice for it to properly load
